## PERFORMANCE-COMPARISON-OF-HYBRID-ENCRYPTION-MODELS
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of hybrid cryptographic systems using the following algorithms AES, Blowfish, RSA, ECC

* Implemented each combo using libraries and compared the performance of each model based on time, CPU usage, Memory usage, Avalanche effect, and NIST test suite.
